# Abstract of the work:
This is the replication code for the simulation study in the preprint paper "Group Average Treatment Effects for Observational Studies". The simulation compares the two-model approach with our proposed method (doubly-robust estimator extention). We generate different data generating processes and perform a Monte Carlo study to compare the MAE of the treatment effect estimator.
